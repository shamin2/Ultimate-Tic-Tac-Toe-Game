**Selina:** "Sal is in the middle of an intense match of an ultimate tic tac toe game online.

**Joel:** "Jacob was in the middle of an ultimate tic-tac-toe game with his friend Bill before he left to go on vacation
for two weeks. Upon returning, he was excited to begin another game with Bill, since they never got to settle their score.
They wanted to start a fresh game, but the server loaded their old game when they both logged in. With no way to end the
game prematurely, they had to allow Bill to win in order to start a new game. This added an undeserved win and loss to 
their respective user statistics. Jacob thinks that having a way to **abort** an ongoing game would have made their experience
much smoother.

Proposed Feature: Option to terminate a match and start a new game.
