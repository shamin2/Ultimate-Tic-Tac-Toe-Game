## Project Description
###  Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe:
__Wikipedia's definition:__ Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a board game composed of nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3 x 3 grid. 
Players take turns playing on the smaller tic-tac-toe boards until one of them wins on the larger board.
    
We will be implementing an Ultimate tic-tac-toe two player game server. We will be using a python-based WSGI server,
using the URL endpoint routing provided by the Bottle web framework.

We will be implementing the following functionality in our server:
* Player registration
* Adding players to a game
* Starting up a game
* Logging into a game
* Making a new move
* Checking if the other player has moved
* Determining the end of the game
* Persisting games between user sessions

We will also be adding some more features and functionality soon.
