**Welcome to the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Game!**
 
You can find instructions here on how the user interface works, so you can make the best out of your gameplay.
 
**A video display is available for you at the end if you want to skip the boring reading!**
 
To start the game: 
- You and your friend should run server.py and go to the localhost that will be created on your computers.
- Enter your names and follow the directions on the screen! 
  - Some things to note here: The usernames are NOT case-sensitive. 
  - You and your friend CAN'T have the same name. This will crash the game. 
  - When you enter your name, a profile for you is created. You can access your win and loss history anytime you log in now. How amazing!
  - This game has less than zero security! Anyone who knows your name can access your profile. But who needs security for a tic-tac-toe game anyway!
- After you enter your name, you'll see your profile. One of you should press create game. This will give you a game id so that your friend can join your game.
- Have your friend click join game and enter the game id on your screen.
- Congrats, you can start playing the game now! The game takes 5 seconds to refresh the page so be patient until your friend's move is displayed on your screen, then you can proceed to make your move.
- When the game ends, a win or loss screen will be displayed. This score will be recorded in your profile for when you come back later, so make sure to keep a good score!
  - The draw logic is not working the best right now. You might encounter some bugs if you and your friend end up in a draw. Don't get frustrated, the team will work on fixing this in the future sprints of the project.
- Now you can go back to game options to start another game.
